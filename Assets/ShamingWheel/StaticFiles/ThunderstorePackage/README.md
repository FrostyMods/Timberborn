# Shaming Wheel

Beavers never really found a reason to evolve their criminal justice system. A stint in the shaming wheel is effective _and_ doubles as an excellent source of power.

## Installation

The recommended way to install this mod is through [Thunderstore](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/). If you decide to install it manually, check [manifest.json](./manifest.json) for the list of dependencies you'll also need to install.

## Usage

You'll find it under the power tab, next to the power wheel. It has different stats and allows bots, but otherwise it functions exactly like the power wheel.

## Features

#### Current
  - Folktails and Ironteeth have their own versions of the shaming wheel
  - Bots can use it

#### Planned

Please keep in mind that these are features I'd _like_ to integrate, but I can't make any promises.

  - A beaver-esque sound clip of "Shame. Shame. Shame" that plays when you select it
  - Shamed beaver status
    - They always sound sad when you select them
    - Maybe they have a shameful hat or something in their avatar 
  - Custom employment logic. Either...
    - The ability to assign a specific beaver or bot to a shaming wheel, or...
    - The shaming wheel is made to only employ beavers or bots that have been marked as shameful
  - Variable power output. Either...
    - A shamer flag is added that employs a worker to shout "shame" at all of the occupied shaming wheels within its coverage area, increasing power production, or...
    - Power output increases (to a limit) depending on how long the beaver or bot has been in the wheel

#### Stretch goals

  - Shamed beavers are a custom worker type, allowing them to be unlocked and assigned to specific workplaces like bots, and including them in the population stats
