<p>Beavers never really found a reason to evolve their criminal justice system. A stint in the shaming wheel is effective <em>and</em> doubles as an excellent source of power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mod brings the shaming wheel to Timberborn. Turn the tears of shamed beavers into raw mechanical power by throwing them in the shaming wheel!</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The shaming wheel works just like the power wheel, except it only hires shamed beavers. </p>
<ol>
<li>Plunk a shaming wheel down (you'll find it in the power category, next to the power wheel)</li>
<li>Find <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">an architect</span> a beaver you want to shame</li>
<li>Click the "Start Shaming" button on that beaver's info panel</li>
</ol>
<p>That's right, no more fartin' around for hours on end trying to assign a specific beaver! It's the solution to a problem only one person in the world has (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwoclAid0CQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you know who you are</a>).</p>
